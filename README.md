# swagger-codegen-generators

- Master: [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators/master.svg?label=Build%20Status)](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators)

## Overview
**Swagger codegen generator** project is a set of classes and templates ([Handlebars](https://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java)) used by [swagger codegen 3.0.0 project](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/3.0.0) in its code generation process for a specific language or language framework. The main differents with **swagger codegen 2.x.x** are:

- **Handlebars as template engine:** with Handelbars feature is possible to create more logic-less templates.
- **OAS 3 support:** generator classes work with OpenAPI Specificacion V3.

More details about these and more differences are referenced at [https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc0)

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* Java 8 (http://java.oracle.com)
* Apache maven 3.0.4 or greater (http://maven.apache.org/)

## How to contribute.
Right now the templates and generators classes are migrated from  [swagger codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) **3.0.0** branch. 
If you want to migrate an existing language/framework, you can follow this [guide](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/Swagger-Codegen-migration-(swagger-codegen-generators-repository)).
Also you need to keep in mind that **Handlebars** is used as template engines and besides it's pretty similar to **Mustache** there are different thar can not be ignored. So you can follow this [guide](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/Swagger-Codegen-migration-from-Mustache-and-Handlebars-templates.) which explains steps to migrate templates from **Mustaches** to **Handelbars**.
